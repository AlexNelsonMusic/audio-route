# audio->route
## Welcome to audio->route!
audio->route is a tool for visualizing live sound and recording setups.
### Ok that's cool and all, but what can I even do with it?
with audio->route, you can:
- Add audio gear images, shapes, and textboxes to an interactive canvas
- Reposition, resize, skew, rotate, nudge, duplicate, and change the color of these items
- Connect gear with color/shape coded lines representing various types of audio cables (implementation in progress!)
- Save your setups as a pdf (it also autosaves everytime you make a change so you do not lose your work on tab/browser close or page reload)
- Compile a list of all the gear in your setup (called gear inventory)
