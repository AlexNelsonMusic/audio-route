## Welcome to audio->route!
audio->route is a tool for visualizing live sound and recording setups.
### Ok that's cool and all, but what can I even do with it?
with audio->route, you can:
- Add audio gear images, shapes, and textboxes to an interactive canvas
- Reposition, resize, skew, rotate, nudge, duplicate, and change the color of items
- Connect gear with color/shape coded lines representing various types of audio cables (implementation in progress!)
- Save your setups as a pdf (it also autosaves everytime you make a change so you don't lose your work on tab/browser close or page reload)
- Compile a list of all the gear in your setup (called gear inventory)
### That's sick! How do I use it?
Here is a list of key commands that are also accessible on the site:
| Action               | Shortcut           |

| Send Item to Back    | Shift + B          |
| Nudge Item           | Arrow Keys         |
| Faster Nudge         | Shift + Arrow Keys |

**Additional Info:**
- **Adding Gear:** Pressing G brings up a search bar in which you can search for any piece of audio gear. Selecting a piece of gear will add an image of it to the canvas. Ideally this will contain a large list of popularly used gear, which I am still adding to. If you don't see your piece of gear on the list, please contact me and I'll add it!
- **Personal Item:** Creates a texbox in which you can add the name of a piece of custom gear, either something not in the gear list or something unique of yours. Then you can create a shape to represent it and drag the text onto it.
- **Note:** Text comment such as "Mic 5" from amp" or "Vocalist likes reverb in monitor"
- F, ShiftF, B, ShiftB: In case it is unclear, these shorcuts cause the selected item to go behind or in front of other items on the canvas.
- **Gear Inventory:** This is intended to use as a checklist for what you should bring to your event or session. Once cables are implemented, these will also appear in the gear inventory.
### Coming features/changes:
- Cable Routing
- Undo/Redo System
- Ability to create and save multiple setups
- Better implementation of custom gear
- Visual Improvements
